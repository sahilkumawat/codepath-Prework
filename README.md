**<h3>App Idea:</h3>**
 **Grouprank**   
 The idea of this app is to create a virtual community with your friends where you can view and make edits to a ranking table. This table could be used to track/rank anything: best table tennis player, person that studies the longest, person that works out the most. Additionally, you can add columns to enhance the use of the ranking table: win/loss ratio, average test score, weightlifting statistics.
